A difference calculator is a program that determines the difference between two data structures. This is a popular task, for which there are many online services, for example, jsondiff. A similar mechanism is used, for example, when outputting tests or when automatically tracking changes in configuration files.

Utility capabilities:
- Support for different input formats: yaml, json
- Generate a report in plain text, stylish and json
